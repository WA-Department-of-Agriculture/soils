```{r options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Installation

Install the development version of {soils} from our [r-universe](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.r-universe.dev/) with:

```{r install-r-universe, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  "soils",
  repos = c(
    "https://wa-department-of-agriculture.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Create the Project

There are two ways to create the {soils} project in RStudio.

### Option 1. RStudio Project Wizard

This is the easiest and recommended way.

`Open RStudio` \> `File` \> `New Project` \> **`Quarto Soil Health Report`**

![](../man/figures/project_wizard.png){width="60%" fig-alt="Screenshot of RStudio New Project Wizard with Quarto Soil Health Report selected."}

A new RStudio project will open with the template Quarto report and a script to render all reports. Other documents and resources will appear in the files pane.

![](../man/figures/new_project.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of new RStudio project called demo-soils. A Quarto file called producer_report.qmd is open and there is a tab for an R script called render_reports.R that renders all reports at once. The files pane is open with a project directory full of other Quarto files, styling resources, example images and data."}

### Option 2. RStudio Console

In the console, replace the path with where you would like the project directory to be created:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
soils::create_soils(path = here::here("soils-demo"))
```

The following will print in your console:

![](../man/figures/create_soils.png){fig-alt="Output from running soils::create_soils(path = here::here('soils-demo')) in the RStudio console"}

This option populates your project directory with all the template files; however, it doesn't open the main template Quarto file `01_producer_report.qmd` or R script `render_reports.R`.

## Project Structure

Both options will create and launch a new RStudio project with the following files:

## Render the Report Template

Open `01_producer_report.qmd` and click the `Render` button at the top of the file to generate either the HTML or MS Word report.

If rendering to HTML, you can check the `Render on Save` option to automatically update the preview whenever you save the document.

![](../man/figures/render.png){style="max-width:80%" fig-alt="RStudio Quarto Render button with a dropdown for HTML and MS Word. Render on Save option is checked."}

This will render the [MS Word Example](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/docx.html) or [HTML Example](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/html.html), depending on which render option you selected.
