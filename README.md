## Overview

As part of the [Washington Soil Health
Initiative](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/), [Washington
State Department of
Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources/soil-health)
and [Washington State University](https://soilhealth.wsu.edu/) developed
`soils` for soil health data visualization and reporting.

Inspired by the [`ratlas`](https://github.com/atlas-aai/ratlas) package
and Spencer Schienâ€™s [blog
post](https://spencerschien.info/post/r_for_nonprofits/quarto_template/)
on including a Quarto template within an R package, `soils` is intended
to help you generate interactive and static reports for each producer or
land owner that participates in your soil sampling project.

## `washi` Theme

Default fonts and colors within `soils` come from the Washington Soil
Health Initiative (WaSHI) branding package
[`washi`](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/washi/). This
allows you to create beautiful plots, tables, and reports out of the
box. Throughout `soils` functions, style sheets, and report templates,
you can customize the fonts and colors to match your own branding.

To install, import, and register the default fonts
([Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) for headings,
[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) for
body text), read these
[instructions](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/washi/#requirements.)

## Requirements

The report template uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/),
which is the next-generation version of R Markdown. Your version of
RStudio must be at least v2022.07 for editing and previewing Quarto
documents. Though it is strongly recommended that you use the [latest
release](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) of RStudio.

To render `.docx` files, you must have Microsoft Word installed.
