## Soil Health

Soil health is a term that describes how well a soil ecosystem supports plants, animals, and humans. It also recognizes the living nature of soils and the importance of soil microorganisms. Healthy soils can provide wildlife habitat, support biodiversity, reduce the effects of climate change, filter air and water, increase crop productivity and food security, and ensure thriving rural economies.

## Qualities of a Healthy Agricultural Soil

-   Good soil tilth allows roots to penetrate
-   Near neutral pH (6--8) maximizes nutrient availability for most crops, and minimizes Al and Mn toxicity
-   Sufficient---but not excessive---nutrient supply for crop growth
-   Small population of plant pathogens and pests
-   Adequate soil drainage and infiltration
-   Diverse and active microbial population
-   Low weed seed bank
-   No residual chemicals or toxins that may harm the crop, including salts
-   Resistance to degradation such as from erosion or surface runoff

## Soil Science 101

A crucial part of the soil health journey is measuring changes in your soil and understanding how to interpret those measurements. We can measure soil health with a range of indicators describing a soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties, which can relate to important soil functions. Each indicator measures a different property of the soil and can be affected differently by management.

To learn more about management practices that support healthy soil, check out these resources from the [Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) principles of building soil health](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/soil-health "NRCS principles of building soil health").
