# Overview

Introducing {soils}: an R package for all your soil health data visualization and reporting needs. {soils} provides an RStudio project template to generate customized, interactive soil health reports. Democratize your data by giving back to the farmers and land managers who contributed soil samples to your survey project. Use {soils} to empower each participant to explore and understand their data.

The [Washington State Department of Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources/soil-health) and [Washington State University](https://soilhealth.wsu.edu/) produced {soils} as part of the [Washington Soil Health Initiative](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/).

# Requirements

The report template uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which is the [next-generation](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html) version of [R Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html).

We assume you're using [RStudio v2022.07](https://dailies.rstudio.com/version/2022.07.2+576.pro12/) or later for editing and previewing Quarto documents. We **strongly recommend** you use the [latest release of RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for support of all Quarto features.

To render Microsoft Word (MS Word) documents, you must have MS Word installed and activated.

**If you're new to Quarto and Markdown formatting syntax, first take a look at the Primers on [Quarto](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/quarto.html) and [Markdown](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/markdown.html) to learn how they're used in {soils} and get familiar with their features.**

# Installation

Install the development version of {soils} from our [r-universe](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.r-universe.dev/) with:

```{r install-r-universe, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  "soils",
  repos = c("https://wa-department-of-agriculture.r-universe.dev")
)
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```{r remotes-install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils")
```

Load the example datasets and functions with:

```{r load-soils, eval=FALSE}
library(soils)
```

# Usage

{soils} was developed to work 'out of the box' so you can immediately install and render an example report. However, you will need to customize and edit content to fit your project.

Our recommended workflow is to **1)** create a new {soils} project, **2)** try to render the example reports to make sure everything works on your system, and **3)** customize the template files to use your own data, content, and styling.

We provide a series of [Primers and Tutorials](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/index.html) to prepare and guide you through this workflow. See below for short demo videos and links to the relevant tutorials.

## 1. Create a new {soils} project

Follow along in the [**Create a {soils} project**](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/project.html) tutorial.

## 3. Create reports with your own data

To use your own data, customize the reports for your project, and render all reports, follow along with these tutorials:

-   [**Import data**](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/data.html)

-   [**Customize & write**](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/customize.html)

-   [**Render reports**](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/render.html)

## Troubleshooting

As you edit the content, errors are bound to occur. Read [**tips and workflows for troubleshooting**](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/troubleshoot.html)

# Acknowledgement and citation

The below acknowledgement is automatically embedded in each report:

```{r acknowledgement, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
acknowledgement <- knitr::knit_child(
  here::here("inst/template/09_acknowledgement.qmd"),
  quiet = TRUE
)

cat(">", acknowledgement)
```

```{r citation-header, results='asis'}
citation <- citation("soils")

header <- format(citation, style = "citation")[[1]]
text <- format(citation, style = "textVersion")

cat(header)
```

```{r citation-text, results='asis'}
cat(">", text)
```
