\title{Complete soil fractions and assign texture class}
\source{
Thresholds for texture classification are from the USDA NRCS Soil
Texture Calculator found at
\url{https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/education-and-teaching-materials/soil-texture-calculator}.
}
\usage{
complete_texture(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing \code{sand_percent}, \code{silt_percent},
and \code{clay_percent}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a new \code{texture} column and fractions rounded
to whole numbers.
}
\description{
Validates and completes soil particle-size fractions (sand, silt, and clay)
and assigns a USDA soil texture class. When exactly one fraction is missing,
it is computed as 100 minus the other two. The function errors if
insufficient information is provided.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  sand_percent = c(60, NA),
  silt_percent = c(30, 20),
  clay_percent = c(10, 20)
)

complete_texture(df)
