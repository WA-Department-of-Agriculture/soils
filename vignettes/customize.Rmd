### Report metadata and options

The report metadata and options are controlled with the YAML and setup chunk in
`01_producer_report.qmd`.

The first place to start is the YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). The YAML
header is the content sandwiched between three dashes (`---`) at the top of the
file. It contains document metadata, parameters, and customization options.

The only fields you need to edit are:

-   `title`: The title of the report. Optionally include your logo above.
-   `subtitle`: Subtitle appears below the title.
-   `producer_id` and `year`: Default parameter values that can be found in your
    data.

```         
---
# EDIT: Replace logo.png in images folder with your own and add project name.
title: "![](images/logo.png) Results from PROJECT NAME"
# EDIT: Subtitle right aligned below title.
subtitle: "Fall 2023"
# EDIT: producer_id and year must be a valid combo that exists in your dataset
params:
  producer_id: WUY05
  year: 2023

# Shouldn't need to edit the below values unless you want to customize.
---
```

Ignore the other YAML fields and values until you would like to explore other
ways of customizing your reports. Learn about the available YAML fields for
[HTML documents](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) and [MS
Word documents](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/docx.html).

### Logo and images

The logo that appears at the top of each report is found in the `images`
subfolder and should be replaced with your organization's logo.

Add or change the measurement group icons (i.e., `biological.png`). These icons
appear in the section headers.

### Report content

`01_producer_report.qmd` uses the Quarto
[`{{< include >}}`](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html) shortcode
to embed static content within the main parameterized reports.

Edit the content of the following Quarto files to fit your project and what
measurements were taken:

```         
├── 03_project_summary.qmd
├── 04_soil_health_background.qmd
├── 05_physical_measurements.qmd
├── 06_biological_measurements.qmd
├── 07_chemical_measurements.qmd
├── 08_looking_forward.qmd
```

Under the `Project Results` heading in `01_producer_report.qmd`, update the
sample depth:

> All samples were collected from [EDIT: SOIL DEPTH (e.g. 0-6 inches, or 0-30
> cm)].

`01_producer_report.qmd` calls `02_secion_template.qmd` as a child document to
generate a section for each `measurement_group` defined in the
`data-dictionary.csv`. You shouldn't need to edit `02_secion_template.qmd`
unless you want more advanced customization.

### Style and theme

The look and feel of your reports can be customized by changing the fonts and
colors to match your branding. The plot and table outputs are controlled by the
`set-fonts-colors` chunk in `01_producer_report.qmd`. The HTML reports are
styled by the `styles.css` file and the MS Word reports are styled using the
`word-template.docx` template file.

#### Set fonts and colors

The third chunk in `01_producer_report.qmd` sets the fonts and colors to be used
in the tables and plots of the report.

<details open>

<summary>`set-fonts-colors` chunk</summary>

```{r set-fonts-colors, eval=FALSE}
# EDIT: Replace any font names and colors to match your branding.

header_font <- "Georgia"
body_font <- "Arial"

# Flextable colors -----------------------------------------------------

# header background color
header_color <- "#023B2C"
# header text color
header_text_color <- "white"
# body darker background color
darker_color <- "#ccc29c"
# body lighter background color
lighter_color <- "#F2F0E6"
# border color
border_color <- "#3E3D3D"

# Map and plot colors -----------------------------------------------------

# point color for producer samples
primary_color <- "#a60f2d"
# point color for samples in same categories as producer
secondary_color <- "#3E3D3D"
# point color for all other samples in project
other_color <- "#ccc29c"

# facet strip background color
strip_color <- "#335c67"
# facet strip text color
strip_text_color <- "white"
```

</details>

#### Style sheets

The style sheets can be found in the `resources` directory and edited to
customize the report appearance to match your own branding.

##### HTML

`styles.css` controls the appearance of HTML reports.

```         
/* Edit these :root variables */
:root {
    --primary-color: #023B2C;
    --secondary-color: #335c67;
    --link-color: #a60f2d;
    --light-color: #F2F0E6;
    --fg-color: white; /* color for text with colored background*/
    --heading-font: "Georgia";
    --body-font: "Arial";
}
```

##### MS Word

Open `word-template.docx` and modify the styles according to this [Microsoft
documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/customize-or-create-new-styles-d38d6e47-f6fc-48eb-a607-1eb120dec563).
