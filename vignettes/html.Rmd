HTML reports contain interactive features such as a table of contents, map, figures, and a downloadable spreadsheet. These reports are 'self-contained', meaning all images and necessary resources are embedded in the file. Consequently, the file size can be quite large.

These reports can be distributed with cloud storage (Google Drive, Box.com, Dropbox.com, etc.). Report recipients must download the `.html` file to their computer and then open the file in their web browser.
