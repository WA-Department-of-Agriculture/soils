## Disclaimer

This repository and package are a **work in progress**.

## Overview

As part of the [Washington Soil Health Initiative](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/), [Washington State Department of Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources/soil-health) and [Washington State University](https://soilhealth.wsu.edu/) developed **`{soils}`** for soil health data visualization and reporting.

## Installation

Install the development version of `soils` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install-github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils")
```

### Requirements

The report template uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which is the next-generation version of R Markdown. Your version of RStudio must be at least v2022.07 for editing and previewing Quarto documents. Though it is strongly recommended that you use the [latest release](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) of RStudio.

To render `.docx` files, you must have Microsoft Word installed.
