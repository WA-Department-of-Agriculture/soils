Troubleshooting Quarto documents can be more challenging than debugging R
scripts. The Quarto environment is different than the R interactive environment,
making it more difficult to debug errors. Additionally, error messages are
generally more informative in the interactive environment.

Errors can occur from:

-   R code issues

-   Quarto document issues

-   Environment issues

# What to do when the report fails to render?

When a report fails to render, the Background Jobs tab of RStudio will likely
open with an error message hinting where the issue occurred. Keep reading to get
an idea of what R code, Quarto document, and environment issues look like and
how to resolve them.

If you're still stuck, see the guides for debugging and plugging error messages
into search engines like Google linked in the [Get help] section.

## R code issues

1.  Note where the error occurred and what the message was.

    If the error was from `purrr::map_chr()` in the
    [`create-measurement-group-sections` chunk], skip to that section in [Common
    errors]. This chunk cannot be run interactively and requires additional
    troubleshooting.

2.  Restart R (`Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `Option`/`Shift` + `F10`).

3.  Run each chunk interactively. If the issue is in the R code, this should
    recreate the problem so you can interactively debug.

4.  Once the error is fixed and the chunk runs successfully, try rendering the
    report again.

To demonstrate, add a typo in the data file name (`washi-dataa.csv` instead of
`washi-data.csv`) and try rendering.

1.  The Background Jobs pane of RStudio opened with an error message telling us
    the location and sequence of calls that led to the function that errored.

    Now we know rendering failed at lines 57-66 in the `load-data` chunk because
    of the `read.csv()` function.

``` r
processing file: 01_producer-report.qmd
1/61                                    
2/61 [setup]                            
3/61                                    
4/61 [load-data]                        

Quitting from lines 57-66 [load-data] (01_producer-report.qmd)
Error in `file()`:
! cannot open the connection
Backtrace:
 1. utils::read.csv(...)
 2. utils::read.table(...)
 3. base::file(file, "rt")
Execution halted
```

2.  Clear the environment by restarting the R session.

3.  Run each chunk interactively. It stops at `load-data` with a more specific
    error message informing us that `washi-dataa.csv` doesn't exist in the
    `data` folder.

    Fix the typo by removing the extra `a`.

``` r
> # Load lab results
> data <- read.csv(
+   here::here("data/washi-dataa.csv"),
+   check.names = FALSE,
+   encoding = "UTF-8"
+ )
Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, "rt") :
  cannot open file 'C:/Users/jryan/Documents/R/projects/soils-demo/data/washi-dataa.csv': 
No such file or directory
```

4.  Rerun the chunk. If successful, try rendering the report.

**Advanced tip:** with your cursor on the function name, press `F2` to peek
inside the source code of that function. You can also access it through `Code`
\> `Go to Function Definition`. This may help you debug any errors from {soils}
functions, or any other package functions. See the [RStudio User
Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/code-navigation.html#go-to-function-definition)
for more details.

## Quarto document issues

Quarto document issues tend to be in the YAML or chunk options. The
troubleshooting steps are generally the same as for R code issues.

1.  Note where the error occurred and what the message was.

2.  Restart R (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F10`).

3.  Try to address the error.

4.  Render again.

To demonstrate, add an extra space before `year:`.

``` yaml
params:
  producer_id: WUY05
   year: 2023
```

Rendering fails and we get the following error message telling us we have bad
indentation at line 9, column 8.

``` yaml
ERROR: YAMLError: bad indentation of a mapping entry at line 9, column 8:
       year: 2023
           ^
```

To fix this, delete the extra space and make sure the entries under `params:`
are aligned.

## Environment issues

Differences between the Quarto environment and the interactive R environment can
cause issues. The most common difference is the working directory. Review the
[File Paths section in the Quarto
primer](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/quarto.html#file-paths).

Check the working directory is what you expect by including `getwd()` in the
`setup` chunk. Running the chunk interactively prints
`"C:/Users/jryan/Documents/R/projects/soils-demo"` in the console, while
rendering the report prints
`"[1] "C:/Users/jryan/Documents/R/projects/soils-demo/template"` in the report.

Sometimes the report won't error, but won't look as expected. For example, if we
move all `.qmd` files into a subfolder called `template`, then our report will
not have access to the `images` or `resources` subdirectories in the main
project folder.

When rendering to HTML, the Background Jobs tab will print the below warnings,
and the report will not have the fonts and colors specified in `styles.css` and
the images will be missing.

```         
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource resources/styles.css
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/logo.png
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/physical.png
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/biological.png
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/chemical.png
Output created: 01_producer-report.html
```

When rendering to MS Word, the report will fail because it cannot find the
`word-template.docx`.

```         
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/logo.png: replacing image with description
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/physical.png: replacing image with description
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/biological.png: replacing image with description
[WARNING] Could not fetch resource images/chemical.png: replacing image with description
File resources/word-template.docx not found in resource path
```

The [`create-measurement-group-sections` chunk] demonstrates a more complicated
environment issue. The chunk runs fine when rendering the report but errors when
running interactively.

# Common errors

## Invalid parameter values

The parameter values set in the YAML header must exist in your data. Fix this
error by either changing `params` in the YAML or by adding the sample results
for that `producer_id` and `year` to your data.

Rendering the report with an invalid `producer_id` and `year` combination
results in the following error message.

```         
Quitting from lines 206-249 [get-producer-info] (01_producer-report.qmd)
Error:
ℹ Update `params` in YAML to a valid `producer_id` and `year` combo.
✖ `Abc` and `2023` must exist in your data.
Backtrace:
Execution halted
```

## Duplicate chunk labels

One common error is duplicated chunk labels, which often occur when copying and
pasting code chunks. To fix this issue, change one of the duplicated labels.

If there are two chunks labeled `setup`, rendering the report will fail with
this error.

```         
processing file: 01_producer-report.qmd
Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src, markdown_mode) : 
  Duplicate chunk label 'setup', which has been used for the chunk:
```

## `create-measurement-group-sections` chunk

This chunk is tricky because it is a child template that creates each
measurement group section to be inserted into the parent report. To learn more,
see the [`knitr::knit_child()` section in the Quarto
primer](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/quarto.html#knitrknit_child).

### Error when run interactively

This chunk will not run because `knitr::knit_child()` is not supposed to be used
interactively (see this [Stack Overflow
response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16847729) from the `knitr` developer Yihui
Xie). If you try running this chunk, you will get the below error message.

``` r
> # create-measurement-group-sections
> #| output: asis
>
> sections <- purrr::map_chr(measurement_groups, \(group) {
+   knitr::knit_child(
+     input = "02_section-template.qmd",
+     envir = rlang::env(),
+     quiet = TRUE
+   )
+ })
Error in `purrr::map_chr()`:
ℹ In index: 1.
Caused by error in `setwd()`:
! character argument expected
```

The output indicates the error occurred from `purrr::map_chr()`. When
`knit_child()` is run interactively, the environment is not correctly passed to
the `envir` argument, resulting in the `character argument expected` from
`setwd()`.

### Error when report rendered

If the report quit from this chunk, it will likely still give you
`` Error in `purrr::map_chr(): ``. Below this, the message may provide further
details such as `` Caused by error `function()`: ``.

1.  Restart R.
2.  In `01_producer-report.qmd`, interactively run all chunks up until this one
    to load the data into your environment.
3.  Open `02_section-template.qmd` and uncomment the `troubleshoot` chunk or
    assign one of your measurement groups to a variable named `group`.
4.  Interactively run each code chunk as described in the [R code issues]
    troubleshooting steps to figure out what errors in this child document.

```

## Duplicate chunk labels

One common error is duplicated chunk labels, which often occur when copying and

If there are two chunks labeled `setup`, rendering the report will fail with
this error.

```

## `create-measurement-group-sections` chunk

This chunk is tricky because it is a child template that creates each
measurement group section to be inserted into the parent report. To learn more,
see the [`knitr::knit_child()` section in the Quarto
primer](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/quarto.html#knitrknit_child).

### Error when run interactively

This chunk will not run because `knitr::knit_child()` is not supposed to be used
interactively (see this [Stack Overflow

``` r
> # create-measurement-group-sections

+     quiet = TRUE
+   )
+ })
Error in `purrr::map_chr()`:
ℹ In index: 1.
Caused by error in `setwd()`:
! character argument expected
```

The output indicates the error occurred from `purrr::map_chr()`. When
`knit_child()` is run interactively, the environment is not correctly passed to
the `envir` argument, resulting in the `character argument expected` from
`setwd()`.

### Error when report rendered

If the report quit from this chunk, it will likely still give you
`` Error in `purrr::map_chr(): ``. Below this, the message may provide further
details such as `` Caused by error `function()`: ``.

1.  Restart R.
2.  In `01_producer-report.qmd`, interactively run all chunks up until the
    `create-measurement-group-sections` chunk to load the data, plots, and
    tables into your environment.
3.  Open `02_section-template.qmd` and uncomment the first chunk or assign one
    of your measurement groups to a variable named `group`.
4.  Interactively run each code chunk as described in the [R code issues]
    troubleshooting steps to figure out what errors in this child document.
