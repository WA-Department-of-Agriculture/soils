Before modifying the data, report content, or style, render the example report
with the anonymized built-in data to ensure your system is set up correctly.

Open `01_producer-report.qmd`. Click the `Render` button to generate an HTML
report or the `down arrow` (â–¼) to open a drop down menu to choose between HTML
or MS Word. Try rendering the example report in both formats.

If rendering to HTML, you can check the `Render on Save` option to automatically
update the preview whenever you save the document.

If the rendered report doesn't immediately open, you can find it in your project
directory with the same name as the main Quarto `.qmd` file
(`01_producer-report.qmd`). Newly rendered files can usually be found at the
bottom of the files pane.

It should take no more than one minute to render a single example report.
