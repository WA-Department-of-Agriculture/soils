\title{Validate soil texture fractions}
\usage{
validate_texture_fractions(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing \code{sample_id} and at least two of
\code{sand_percent}, \code{silt_percent}, and \code{clay_percent}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with validated soil texture fraction columns
(\code{sand_percent}, \code{silt_percent}, \code{clay_percent}). If exactly two of the
fractions are present, the third is computed as \verb{100 - sum(other two)}.
}
\description{
Internal helper that validates soil particle-size fractions (sand, silt,
and clay). If exactly two of the three fraction columns are present, the
missing column is created and filled with \code{NA}. If fewer than two fraction
columns are present, texture validation and classification are skipped.
}
\details{
Fractions are rounded prior to validation. Errors if two or more fractions
are missing for any sample and warns if exactly one fraction is missing.
