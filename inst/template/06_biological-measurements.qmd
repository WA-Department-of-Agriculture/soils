***Soil Organic Matter*** (SOM) is the portion of soils not made up of minerals,
air, and water, but is instead composed of animal, plant, and microbial matter
in various stages of decomposition. SOM is comprised of approximately 58%
organic carbon (to convert total organic carbon (TOC) to SOM, an easy rule of
thumb is to simply multiply by 2). The remaining portion of SOM includes other
essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur. SOM varies
by inherent soil and landscape properties such as texture, mineralogy,
precipitation, and temperature. It is also greatly impacted by management. To
learn more about how to increase SOM, read about the [NRCS principles of
building soil
health](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/soil-health "NRCS principles of building soil health").
SOM underlies many of the benefits and ecosystem services that soils provide. It
has a large impact on almost all other soil properties and is often used as a
primary indicator of soil health. However, SOM can be slow to change as the
result of management. Because of this, many other indicators have been developed
to detect more sensitive components in SOM. Keep reading to learn more.

***Potentially Mineralizable Carbon*** (MinC, frequently referred to as "Soil
Respiration") measures the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from soil. This
measurement is done in a laboratory incubation under controlled conditions
"ideal" for microbes. The term mineralization refers to the process in which
soil microbes produce CO₂ as they decompose SOM and plant residues. This process
also releases other nutrients, like nitrogen, which can be taken up by crops.
Higher MinC represents greater potential biological activity. Soils with lower
SOM will have inherently lower MinC, while compacted soils may not provide
adequate aeration for the mineralization process.

***Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon*** (POXC, once referred to as "Active Carbon")
is a fraction of SOM that is more quickly influenced by changes in management
(compared to SOM, which can take up to ten years to detect a difference). In
this laboratory test, a portion of SOM is decomposed or oxidized by potassium
permanganate. POXC levels are often associated with practices that lead to
long-term organic matter storage, and may represent a portion of SOM that is
from plant material, including compounds related to plant defense.

***Potentially Mineralizable Nitrogen*** (PMN) represents the amount of organic
nitrogen that can be converted (or "mineralized") to plant-available nitrate or
ammonium. This measurement is taken from a laboratory incubation and can help
producers estimate how much nitrogen may be released to crops during the growing
season. Additional information on the measurement and interpretation of PMN can
be found in this [Extension Publication from Oregon State
University](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/em9281.pdf "Extension Publication from Oregon State University").

***ACE Soil Protein*** is the fraction of SOM comprised of proteins from soil
microorganisms. Proteins contain nitrogen that can be mineralized for plant
uptake, and are therefore an important contributor to crop growth. ACE stands
for autoclaved citrate-extractable, which is the laboratory method for
extracting the proteins. ACE soil protein is related to aggregate stability as
it partly measures proteins that are physically sticky and hold soil particles
together. ACE is also sensitive to management changes, so can be a valuable
indicator for evaluating relatively short-term changes in soil health.
