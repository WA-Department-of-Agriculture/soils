## Soil Health

Soil health is a term that describes how well a soil ecosystem supports plants,
animals, and humans. It also recognizes the living nature of soils and the
importance of soil microorganisms. Healthy soils can provide wildlife habitat,
support biodiversity, reduce the effects of climate change, filter air and
water, increase crop productivity and food security, and ensure thriving rural
economies.

## Qualities of a Healthy Agricultural Soil

-   Good soil tilth allows roots to penetrate
-   Near neutral pH (6--8) maximizes nutrient availability for most crops, and
    minimizes Al and Mn toxicity
-   Sufficient---but not excessive---nutrient supply for crop growth
-   Small population of plant pathogens and pests
-   Adequate soil drainage and infiltration
-   Diverse and active microbial population
-   Low weed seed bank
-   No residual chemicals or toxins that may harm the crop, including salts
-   Resistance to degradation from sources like erosion or surface runoff

## Soil Science 101

A crucial part of the soil health journey is measuring changes in your soil and
understanding how to interpret those measurements. We can measure soil health
with a range of indicators describing a soil's physical, chemical, and
biological properties, which can relate to important soil functions. Each
indicator measures a different property of the soil and can be affected
differently by management.

To learn more about management practices that support healthy soil, check out
these resources from the [Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
principles of building soil
health](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/soil-health "NRCS principles of building soil health").

## Soil Health Indicators

The below table describes: 1. What each indicator helps measure in your soil; 2.
Whether you want the measured value to be higher (more is better), lower (less
is better), or in the middle (optimal range); and 3. How often to measure each
indicator. This table reflects our current understanding, though the science is
rapidly evolving as researchers measure these indicators in diverse soils,
cropping systems, and climates.

## Soil Health Testing

![](https://raw.githack.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils/main/figures/quality-results.png){width="6.5in"
fig-alt="Infographic titled How to Get Quality Results. Be Consistent: sample at the same time each year; send samples to the same lab; keep samples cool and get them to the lab quickly; keep good records of lab results. Context matters: not all soils are created equal; indicators are impacted by inherent properties like climate and soil texture; as well as by management; don't be alarmed if your soil is below the optimal range fro some indicators, see how far you can take your soil with management but know there may be inherent limitations. Back to the Basics: old school measurements like pH, texture, and soil organic matter are still incredible important; new indicators are constantly being developed, don't feel you have to measure all of them, or let the process overwhelm you; have fun exploring through a soil health lens, but remember that you know your soil better than anyone! Be Patient: some measurements may not change as quickly as you'd like; sampling across time is very important, our scientific understanding of these measurements is evolving; we are all on this journey together."}
