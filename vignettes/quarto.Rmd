If you're new to Quarto, first check out the [**Hello, Quarto tutorial**](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).

## File paths

`soils::create_soils(path = "soils-demo")` creates an RStudio Project with the template `.qmd` files, example data, R script, and `soils-demo.Rproj` file that designates the directory as an RStudio Project. All template files use **relative paths** instead of absolute paths to ensure the file paths work on anyone's computer.

### Absolute vs relative paths

❌ **Absolute paths** start with the root directory and provide the full path to a specific file or folder like `C:/Users/jryan/Documents/R/projects/soils-demo/data/washi-data.csv`. This path will not work on anyone's computer unless the user, directory structure, and folder names match exactly.

✅ **Relative paths** are *relative* to the working directory (i.e. the project's home) like `data/washi-data.csv`. When working in a RStudio project, the default working directory is always the **root** project directory (where the `.Rproj` file is). This path will work on anyone's computer that has this project directory.

### {here} package

When the Quarto file renders, its default current working directory is wherever the `.qmd` file lives. To make code more robust, the [{here}](https://here.r-lib.org/) package builds *relative* file paths. {here} also takes care of the backslashes or forward slashes so the relative path will work no matter the operating system.

For example, in our new {soils} project, `01_producer-report.qmd` imports data using `read.csv(here::here("data/washi-data.csv"))`.

## Parameterized reporting

{soils} uses Quarto to help you generate **parameterized** reports for each participant in your survey from the same template file.

Parameterized reports are like complex functions where the **function** is the `.qmd` template, the **input** are the parameters, and the **output** are the reports.

Many arrows lead from the `.qmd` file to the reports/output as five different reports representing five different years."}

To learn more about parameterized reporting, see the materials for [Jadey Ryan's 20-minute presentation](https://jadeyryan.com/talks/2023-09-25_posit_parameterized-quarto/), follow along with a [2-hour R-Ladies Washington D.C. workshop](https://jadeyryan.quarto.pub/rladies-dc-quarto-params/), or read the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/parameters.html).

## Quarto specific features

{soils} takes advantage of several intermediate -- advanced Quarto features, listed below with references for further information.

### Shortcodes

Shortcodes are special markdown directives that generate various types of content. Read more in the [Shortcodes article](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/shortcodes.html).

**Includes** are used to keep plain markdown content (e.g., background on soil health measurements) in a separate document to keep the main `01_producer-report.qmd` a reasonable number of lines. Read more in the [Includes article](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html).

``` r
{{< include 04_soil-health-background.qmd >}}
```

**Pagebreaks** insert native pagebreaks into a document regardless of the output (e.g., HTML, MS Word, LaTex PDF, etc.). Read more in the [Pagebreaks article](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#page-breaks).

``` r
{{< pagebreak >}}
```

### Conditional Content

Conditional content is used to control which content is displayed only for HTML reports which content is displayed only for MS Word reports. To make content visible only for a given format, use a div (`:::`) with the `.content-visible` class and `when-format=""` attribute. Read more in the [Conditional Content article](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html).

See the tabset section below for an example.

### Tabsets

Tabsets work only in HTML documents and are created with the `::: {.panel-tabset}` div. Each top-level heading within the div creates a new tab. Read more in the [Tabsets article](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#tabsets).

The below example shows how the Includes shortcode, conditional content, and tabsets are used in `04_soil-health-background.qmd`.

``` markdown
::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
:::: panel-tabset
{{< include 05_physical-measurements.qmd >}}

{{< include 06_biological-measurements.qmd >}}

{{< include 07_chemical-measurements.qmd >}}
::::
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="html"}
{{< include 05_physical-measurements.qmd >}}

{{< include 06_biological-measurements.qmd >}}

{{< include 07_chemical-measurements.qmd >}}
:::
```
