## Overview

As part of the [Washington Soil Health Initiative](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/), [Washington State Department of Agriculture](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources/soil-health) and [Washington State University](https://soilhealth.wsu.edu/) developed `soils` for soil health data visualization and reporting.

## Disclaimer

This repository and package are a **work in progress**.

## Installation

Install the development version of `soils` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install-github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WA-Department-of-Agriculture/soils")

# Load all the example data sets and functions
library(soils)
```

## Requirements

The report template uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which is the next-generation version of R Markdown.

We assume you're working in RStudio Desktop. This workflow has not been tested in other IDEs such as Visual Studio Code. Your version of RStudio must be at least v2022.07 for editing and previewing Quarto documents. Though it is strongly recommended that you use the [latest release](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) of RStudio.

To render `.docx` files, you must have Microsoft Word installed.

## Creating a New `soils` Project

After installing `soils`, you can use the RStudio IDE or the `soils::create_soils()` function to create a new RStudio project with all the example data, Quarto files, style sheets, images, and R scripts needed to generate some example soil health reports.

Read the article [Create New Template Project](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/project.html) to learn what goodies are bundled within `soils`.

To view the vignette within RStudio, run the command `vignette("project", "soils")`.

## Parameterized Soil Health Reports

This package can help you generate custom static `.docx` reports and interactive `.html` reports for every producer or land owner in your soil health survey project.

Read the article [Write Soil Health Reports](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/report.html) for a detailed walk through the project and workflow for adopting this template for your own project.

To view the vignette within RStudio, run the command `vignette("report", "soils")`.

Check out our example reports:

-   [MS Word](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/docx.html) or `vignette("docx", "soils")`
-   [HTML](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/html.html) or `vignette("html", "soils")`

## Acknowledgement and Citation

The below acknowledgement and citation are automatically embedded in each report.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
acknowledgement <- knitr::knit_child(
  "./inst/template/inst/_07_acknowledgement.qmd", 
  quiet = TRUE)

cat(acknowledgement, sep = "\n")
```
