Thank you for being a participant in our [State of the Soils
Assessment](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com/state-of-the-soils/ "State of the Soils Assessment Webpage").
This work would not be possible without your collaboration and input.

The goals of our project are to:

<!-- Image wrapped around text for HTML -->

**1)** Assess baseline soil health in Washington;

**2)** Understand how climate, crop type, and management impact soil health;

**3)** Develop cost-effective ways for producers to assess their own soil
health, and;

**4)** Develop crop- and region-specific decision support tools.

To date, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), Washington State
University (WSU), conservation districts, and agricultural professionals across
Washington have sampled from nearly **900** fields planted in more than **60**
crop types or land uses. We are excited to share with you some preliminary
results with data from your fields.
