{soils} was developed to work 'out of the box' so you can immediately install and render an example report, as demonstrated in the last two tutorials. However, this means it will require customization and content editing to fit your project, shown in the next three tutorials.

{soils} includes an example data set and data dictionary to use as templates. These files are automatically loaded when you call `library(soils)`, and also are found in the `data` folder. They allow you to try out the visualization functions and report rendering immediately after installing {soils} on your machine.

### Example data

Glimpse at the example data structure:

<details open>

<summary>Example Data</summary>

```{r}
library(soils)
dplyr::glimpse(washi_data)
```

</details>

All column names in your data, besides measurements, must be exactly the same as above.

Each measurement must be in its own column and have the format of `measurement_unit` (i.e. `Ca_mg.kg`). These measurement column names must match the `column_name` in your data dictionary.

### Data dictionary

The data dictionary is used to group and order the measurements. It is also used to make nicely formatted labels for display in tables and plots. The example data dictionary contains `UTF-8` encoded superscripts and subscripts.

Save your data dictionary to the `data` folder as `CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv)` in MS Excel:

![](../man/figures/utf-8.png){fig-alt="Data dictionary is saved as CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) (*.csv) in MS Excel."}

Your data dictionary must have the exact same column names as the example:

<summary>Example Data Dictionary</summary>

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(data_dictionary)
```

-   `measurement_group` determines how the measurements are grouped.
-   `order` column specifies the order in which the measurements appear in each measurement group's tables and plots.
-   `column_name` is the join key for joining with your project data.
-   `abbr` and `unit` are how the measurements are represented in `flextable` tables.
-   `abbr_unit` is formatted with HTML line breaks for `ggplot2` plots.

### Your data

Once your project data and data dictionary files match the structure of the above examples, place them in the `data` folder. Then make the following changes in the `load-data` chunk in `01_producer_report.qmd`:

-   Change `washi-data.csv` to the name of your data file.
-   Change `data-dictionary.csv` to the name of your data dictionary.
-   Set the order of the `measurement_groups` to how you would like them to appear in the report. These group names must match your data dictionary.

### Checking data with `assertr`

The `assertr` functions check that your data and dictionary have the required columns and are consistent with each other.

To demonstrate troubleshooting with data and dictionary mismatches, I changed `totalN_%` to `totalN%` in the dictionary `column_name`. Rendering the report will fail because there is no column name in `data` that matches `totalN%`:

```         
Quitting from lines 55-119 [load-data] (01_producer_report.qmd)
Error:
! assertr stopped execution
Backtrace:
 1. assertr::assert(...)
 2. assertr (local) error_fun(errors, data = data)
Execution halted
```

Unfortunately this error message in the Background Jobs tab is not very helpful. It tells us that the error occurred in lines 55-119 in the [load-data] chunk.

If we run that chunk in `01_producer_report.qmd`, we get a more helpful error message:

```         
Column 'column_name' violates assertion 'assertr::in_set(names(data))' 1 time
    verb redux_fn                    predicate      column index   value
1 assert       NA assertr::in_set(names(data)) column_name    12 totalN%

Error: assertr stopped execution
```

We can see that the error occurred in `assertr::in_set(names(data))` and the problematic value is `totalN%`. We could then look at the columns in `data` and realize that it should be `totalN_%` and correct that value in our `dictionary`.
