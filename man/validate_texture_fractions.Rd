\title{Validate soil texture fractions}
\usage{
validate_texture_fractions(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing \code{sample_id} and at least two of
\code{sand_percent}, \code{silt_percent}, and \code{clay_percent}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with validated soil texture fraction columns
(\code{sand_percent}, \code{silt_percent}, \code{clay_percent}). If exactly two of the
fractions are present, the third is created and filled with \code{NA} for
downstream completion.
}
\description{
Internal helper that validates soil particle-size fractions (sand, silt, and
clay). If exactly two of the three fraction columns are present, the missing
column is created and filled with \code{NA} to be later computed in
\code{complete_texture_fractions()}. Samples with fewer than two provided
fractions are retained but skipped during texture validation and
classification.
}
\details{
Fractions are rounded prior to validation. Warns if fewer than two fractions
are provided or if exactly one fraction is missing. Errors if fraction values
are outside the allowable range (0-100) or if complete fractions do not sum
to 100 (+/- 1).
