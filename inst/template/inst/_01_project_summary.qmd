:::

**1)** Assess baseline soil health in Washington;

**2)** Understand how climate, crop type, and management impact soil health;

**3)** Develop cost-effective ways for producers to assess their own soil health, and;

**4)** Develop crop- and region-specific decision support tools.

To date, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), Washington State University (WSU), conservation districts, and agricultural professionals across Washington have sampled from nearly **900** fields planted in more than **60** crop types or land uses. We are excited to share with you some preliminary results with data from your fields.
