# Example reports

## HTML

HTML reports contain interactive features such as a table of contents,
map, figures, and a downloadable spreadsheet. These reports are
“self-contained” and embed all dependencies in the HTML file. As a
result, the file size can be quite large.

These reports can be distributed with cloud storage (Google Drive,
Box.com, Dropbox.com, etc.). Report recipients must download the `.html`
file to their computer and then open the file in their web browser.
